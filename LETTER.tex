\opening{Dear Editor,}

I am writing on behalf of the authors (Theodore Chang and Chin-Long Lee) to submit the manuscript entitled \textit{Reformulation of a Concentrated Plasticity Frame Element With $N$-$M$ Interaction Based on the Generalised Plasticity Theory}.

In this manuscript, a concentrated plasticity frame element is proposed. The new formulation combines $N$-$M$ interaction and the generalised plasticity theory together with flexible hardening rules to simulate different hardening behaviour of different resistance components (axial force/moment). The proposed element, as an improvement of previous versions, corrects hardening behaviour, and thus is more reliable.

The authors agree on the submission to \textit{Computers \& Structures}. Please feel free to appoint reviewers since there is no known conflict.
