\opening{Dear Editor,}

I am writing to submit the manuscript entitled \textit{Spurious Response Due to Linear Interpolation of Input Load and Some Remedies}.

In this manuscript, one type of spurious responses caused by linear interpolation in dynamic analysis is identified. Since linear interpolation is widely used as the de facto procedure, its implication is often ignored previously. The work quantitatively analysed its impact on dynamic responses of linear systems. To improve the quality of numerical results, a number of remedies and recommendations that augment the existing dynamic analysis workflow are proposed.

Please feel free to appoint reviewers since there is no known conflict.
