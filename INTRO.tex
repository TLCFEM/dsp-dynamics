\section{Introduction}
In this work, in order to reveal the spurious response due to interpolation, the analytical expressions for damping/inertial forces of linear systems under upsampled external loads in the frequency domain are derived using the Fourier transform as the main tool. It is then further elaborated with the numerical simulation of a simple SDOF oscillator. Remedies and recommendations to ease the issue are then discussed. To showcase its impact on practical structures, a constrained cantilever is analysed under seismic loading. Based on the discussions, a revised analysis workflow is proposed for response history analysis.
